# Bandit Linux Progress

This repository contains my progress through the **OverTheWire Bandit Game** as part of the [CoderCo DevOps Linux Module](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

I started tracking my solutions from **Level 10 onward** (earlier progress wasnâ€™t saved), and completed through **Level 20** as required for the module.

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure

- **Levels 10â€“15** â†’ Written explanations of what I did and why  
- **Levels 16â€“20** â†’ Command logs of the steps I took (less explanation, more raw process)  

This shows my shift from carefully writing things out to working faster and just capturing commands as I went.

## âœ… What I Learned
- Navigating the Linux file system efficiently  
- Working with hidden files and unusual filenames  
- Using `ssh` for remote access  
- Handling permissions and setuid binaries  
- Reading and comparing files with tools like `cat` and `diff`  
- Understanding basic networking with `nc` (netcat) and ports  
- Applying job control and multiple terminals when needed  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Add more explanations to levels 16â€“20 when I revisit them  
- Continue with higher Bandit levels for extra practice  
- Apply these fundamentals in real-world DevOps workflows
